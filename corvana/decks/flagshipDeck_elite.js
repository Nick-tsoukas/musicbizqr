        subhead: '',
        body: 'Link pages are snapshots. Social reach is rented. Fans fall off after one click.',
        speakerNotes: 'Pain, fast. Every artist has a Linktree. None of them work. Social algorithms change weekly. The fan journey is fragmented and leaky.'

        body: 'The page feels alive because it reflects real activity.',
        speakerNotes: 'Bridge to live feed. When fans see other fans engaging, they engage more. Social proof becomes built into the surface itself.'

        body: '"Chicago is feeling it" hits different than "Check out my new single."',
        speakerNotes: 'Key insight: fans don\'t want to be marketers, but they LOVE sharing receipts. A city moment, a support badge, a "you were here" card—these spread because they\'re authentic proof of connection, not promotion.'
